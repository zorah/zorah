# Open Positions

I am currently looking to fill one PhD position with a starting date mid or end of 2024. There might be the option for a postdoc position, please contact me directly for more information.

## PhD Positions

I am looking for motivated students interested in exploring geometric problems in the broader context of machine learning and computer vision. My research is not only about what is possible and how but also about the why so an interest in mathematical understanding and curiosity about theory is required. Previous experience with machine learning or geometry processing are not required but an advantage. 
Incoming students need to hold a Master's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field, and have advanced English skills (no German required). Experience with any programming language (preferably Python or the willingness to learn Python) is required. 

All PhD positions are full-time employee positions at the University of Bonn and remunerated in accordance to public service pay grade [TV-L E 13](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l-2023&matrix=1). The contract will be fixed-term for three years with the possibility of extension to up to six years depending on funding. Participation in the groups teaching responsibilities is expected but the majority of time is reserved for research. 


### How to Apply

If you are interested, please send your application to laehner at uni-bonn.de by February 7th, 2024. Later applications might also be considered depending on availability. 
The application should include a cover letter stating your reasons for applying, a deeper dive into what research problems are interesting to you and how they related to "Geometry in Machine Learning", a CV, and the (provisional) transcript of record from your studies. You may also include any additonal material relevant for your application (for example, link to Github repository you are especially proud of, description of interesting projects you did, unrelated achievements that show your dedication) or contact details for reference person you worked with before. Applications that are not clearly directed towards my group (including my name and the title of one of my publications does not count) will probably be discarded.


## HiWi Positions

Unfortunately, I do not have funding for student researcher positions at the moment.
